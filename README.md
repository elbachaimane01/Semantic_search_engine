# Semantic search engine
Keyword searches are quite literal in the sense that computers  nd terms wherever they ap- pear—even if part of a larger phrase or used in a di erent context. This approach is e ective if the researcher knows exactly what they are looking for. The problem is words often have multiple meanings, so keyword searches often return irrelevant results (false positives), failing to disambiguate unstructured text.
Keyword searches may also fail to turn up related materials that don’t speci cally use the search term (false negatives). Under these conditions, researchers can miss pertinent information. There is also the danger of making business decisions based on a less than comprehensive set of search results.
Unlike keyword search, semantic search takes into consideration the researcher’s intent to get at the contextual meaning of terms. Semantic search pushes beyond the boundaries of the orga- nization’s collective base of understanding to get at information and concepts that haven’t been explicitly written into the query. Semantic technology deciphers concepts and meaning by associ- ating search inputs with clarifying terms such as related synonyms that have been built into the system.
This is possible because of the process of semantic enrichment which helps researchers  nd new ideas and concepts by tagging unstructured text with information about its meaning. To distinguish concepts, semantic technology references vocabularies that contain all known terms for the same thing, relates these entities to each other in hierarchical relationships, and employs algorithms to analyze the context within which those terms appear.
In this technical assignment, we’re gonna tackle an approach to build a semantic search engine. The main parts of this assignment are:
1. Data processing
2. Search queries processing
3. algorithm structure and techniques
